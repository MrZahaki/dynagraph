# Dynagraph

Dynagraph is a dynamic graph visualization tool built with Cytoscape and React. This interactive platform allows users to manage nodes, edit edge weights, toggle draw modes, and visualize optimal paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features

- **Graph Editing:** Easily add, remove, and manage nodes and edges.
- **Edge Weight Modification:** Double-click edges to modify their weights.
- **Draw Mode:** Enable/disable draw mode by holding and releasing the right-click button.
- **Optimal Path Visualization:** Utilize Dijkstra's algorithm to highlight optimal paths.
- **Interactive Controls:** Double-click to remove nodes and edges.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Launch the application with `npm start`.

## Usage

- **Adding Nodes:** Click "Add Node" to create new nodes.
- **Edge Editing:** Double-click on edges to modify their weights.
- **Draw Mode:** Hold right-click to enable dynamic edge creation. Release to disable.
- **Optimal Path:** Select start and stop nodes to visualize the optimal path.
- **Removing Elements:** Double-click nodes or edges to remove them interactively.
